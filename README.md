# Overview

This repository provides the source code for the generation of thorax CT scans with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This framework uses a pix2pix model to generate the lungs with the clinical presentations of ARDS and merged with the target organs to create highly realistic CT images. The implementation was performed using Tensorflow.
